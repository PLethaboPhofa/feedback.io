UI
    - I dont have a theme, or any UI philosophy yet, please generate a page for collecting free form feedback, it should also include a thumb up button and a thumb down button, also a submit button
Features
- Timeline
    - Horizontal which is aggregated ( 1 day, total results)
    - Thumbs 
    - Feedback
    - Vertical view which is social feed
- Word cloud
- Insights 
    -> Summary
    -> Repeated themes
    -> Ratings ( thumb up, thumb down) 

UX
- No submit button for ratings, data is persisted instantly

FAQs
- Why? When two or more people report the same thing about you, even years apart, that thing is likely true
    I want to help people ground their peceprions about themselves in reality by harnessing the wisdom of the crowd
- What if I get no feedback, no feedback is feedback,
- Why wouldn't I  solicit feedback directly ( its not anonymous, its not asynchronous, its not persistent, its not analysed, let us take care of all of that for you, free forever also When multiple independent observers (or data sources) provide noisy signals about some underlying truth, aggregating those signals can yield a much more accurate estimate of that truth than any single signal on its own.)


Who? Anyone interested in their perfomance in interactions, perfomance meaning delivering clarity and satisfation, mostly independent contractors.
What? An anonymous feedback collection, persistance, analysis and presentation platform
When? Instantly, send a link collect feedback, 2 clicks ( unless you tpe)
Where? Social channels, QR codes for in place rating
Why? You perception of reality is as good as your ability to tell when someone is lying, scientifically, it has been proven to be non existannt
How? 
    Feedback is collected anonymously
    Analysed using Interrater reliability ( ), 
    Trend analysis, Topic clustering, Sentiment analysis,
    Outlier detection,
    Correlation mapping ( People who rate you high on “clarity” also tend to rate you high on “trustworthiness.” ??? Reinhard et al. (2011): Clear, fluent communication increases perceived honesty and competence.)
    Stability of traits
    Perceived trait confidence ( The probability that a reported behavior reflects reality, based on how often it independently appears)

- In future
    - Proudly share you rating publically, show people how highly you are rated!

- For chat gpt later
Would you like me to outline a data model and algorithmic approach (e.g., how to mathematically combine multiple anonymous reports into a “truth probability” score)? It could help make your concept more concrete. -> Do this\\
